# Manual Stock Adjustment Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The Manual Stock Adjustment feature has been successfully implemented as a robust, user-friendly, mobile-optimized solution for managing inventory stock levels in the Smartback system.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Mobile-First Responsive Design
- **Edge-to-edge layout**: Full viewport width utilization without horizontal padding
- **Layout isolation**: Content properly positioned to avoid mobile menu overlap
- **Responsive header**: Clean search bar with integrated filter system
- **Bottom padding**: 100px padding ensures content visibility above fixed mobile menu

### 2. Modern UI Components (Joy UI)
- **Consistent design system**: Fully migrated from Material-UI to Joy UI
- **Compact row layout**: Cardless design matching Orders page style
- **Color-coded icons**: Visual movement type indicators (↑↓⚖)
- **Quantity chips**: Color-coded quantity display with proper +/- formatting
- **Toast notifications**: Replaced browser alerts with elegant Joy UI Snackbar

### 3. Advanced Filtering System
- **Filter modal**: Comprehensive filtering by movement type, product, and reason category
- **Active filter chips**: Visual indication of applied filters below search bar
- **Clear all functionality**: Easy filter reset capability
- **Search integration**: Text search across multiple fields

### 4. Stock Adjustment Workflow
- **Product selection**: Dropdown with product names and IDs
- **Current stock display**: Real-time calculation and display
- **Adjustment calculation**: Automatic difference calculation with visual feedback

- **Reason tracking**: Required reason field for audit trail
- **Validation**: Comprehensive form validation and error handling

### 5. Database Integration
- **Signed quantity support**: Simplified adjustment storage with positive/negative values
- **Negative stock prevention**: Database triggers prevent invalid stock levels
- **Audit trail**: Complete movement history with reasons and timestamps
- **Real-time updates**: Immediate data refresh after adjustments

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created

5. **Toast Notifications**: Eliminated browser alerts for better UX

### Database Schema
- Stock movements table supports signed quantities for adjustments
- Movement types: 'incoming', 'outgoing', 'adjustment'
- Comprehensive audit trail with timestamps and reasons
- UUID-based product references for consistency

## User Experience Features

### Intuitive Interface
- **Subtle FAB**: Small, non-intrusive "+ Movement" button

# Recommended Way to Organize a Buildable Application in Vercel

When deploying an application to Vercel, it is essential to follow best practices to ensure that the application builds correctly and all files are loaded as expected. Below are the recommended strategies:

## 1. Set the Correct Build Output Directory

- By default, Vercel expects the build output to be in the `public` folder for static files or the `.next` folder for Next.js apps.
- If you are using a custom setup, specify the output directory in the `vercel.json` file. For example:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build" }
  ],
  "outputDirectory": "public"
}
```

## 2. Use a `vercel.json` Rewrite Rule

- For React apps using React Router, ensure all routes are rewritten to `index.html` to support client-side routing:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Ensure All Dependencies Are Installed

- Make sure all dependencies are listed in `package.json` and installed during the build process. Vercel automatically runs `npm install` or `yarn install` during deployment.

## 4. Check Static Assets

- Place all static assets (e.g., images, fonts) in the `public` folder. These files will be served directly by Vercel.

## 5. Verify Environment Variables

- Ensure all required environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard under the "Environment Variables" section.

## 6. Clear Cache and Redeploy

- If files are not found, clear the Vercel cache and redeploy. You can do this using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
vercel --force
```

## 7. Test Locally Before Deploying

- Use the Vercel CLI to test your app locally:

```bash
vercel dev
```

## 8. Check Build Logs

- Review the build logs in the Vercel dashboard to identify any missing files or errors during the build process.

## 9. Organize Your Project Structure

- Ensure your project structure is clean and follows conventions:

```
/src
  /components
  /pages
  /utils
/public
  /assets
package.json
vercel.json
```

By following these strategies, you can ensure that your application is consistently buildable and deployable on Vercel.

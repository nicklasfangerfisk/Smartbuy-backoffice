# New Mobile Menu Design

## Overview
The new mobile menu design replaces the sidebar with a dynamic selection box for navigating between major content areas (Sales, Support, Marketing, Operations). Once an area is selected, the mobile menu dynamically updates to display submenus specific to that area.

---

## Features

### 1. **Dynamic Area Selection**
- A menu button opens a selection box listing the main content areas:
  - Sales
  - Support
  - Marketing
  - Operations
- Users can select an area to navigate to its submenus.

### 2. **Dynamic Submenus**
- After selecting an area, the mobile menu updates to display submenus specific to that area.
- Example:
  - **Sales**:
    - Orders
    - Products
    - Customers
  - **Support**:
    - Tickets
    - Users
  - **Marketing**:
    - SMS Campaigns
    - Email Campaigns
  - **Operations**:
    - Inventory
    - Movements

### 3. **Simplified Navigation**
- Removes the need for a sidebar.
- Provides a clean and intuitive navigation experience for mobile users.

## Best Practices for Mobile Navigation

### 1. **Consistency**
- Ensure consistent design and behavior across all navigation elements.
- Use clear labels and icons for menu items.

### 2. **Accessibility**
- Ensure the menu is accessible to all users:
  - Use ARIA roles and labels.
  - Provide keyboard and screen reader support.

### 3. **Responsiveness**
- Optimize the menu for different screen sizes.
- Use Material-UI’s `useMediaQuery` to adapt the layout dynamically.

### 4. **Performance**
- Minimize the number of re-renders when switching between areas.
- Use React’s `useMemo` and `useCallback` for efficient state management.

### 5. **User Feedback**
- Provide visual feedback for user actions:
  - Highlight the selected area and submenu.
  - Use animations or transitions for smooth navigation.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. **Selection Box Component**
- Create a new component for the selection box.
- Use Material-UI’s `Dialog` or `Menu` for the selection box.

### 2. **Dynamic Submenu Component**
- Create a new component for the dynamic submenu.
- Use Material-UI’s `BottomNavigation` for the submenu.

### 3. **State Management**
- Use React’s `useState` to manage the selected area and submenu.
- Example:
  ```tsx
  const [selectedArea, setSelectedArea] = useState<'Sales' | 'Support' | 'Marketing' | 'Operations' | null>(null);
  const [submenus, setSubmenus] = useState<string[]>([]);
  ```

### 4. **Integration**
- Replace the current mobile menu with the new design.
- Ensure seamless integration with existing navigation logic.

## Next Steps
- Implement the selection box and dynamic submenu components.
- Test the new mobile menu for functionality and responsiveness.
- Update the documentation as needed.

**Maintainer Note:**
This documentation should be reviewed and updated as the project evolves, especially if new navigation paradigms are introduced.

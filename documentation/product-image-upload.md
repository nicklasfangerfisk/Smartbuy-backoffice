ALTER TABLE "Products" 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "ImageUrl" TEXT;

-- Add index for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_products_imageurl ON "Products"("ImageUrl");

-- Add documentation comment
COMMENT ON COLUMN "Products"."ImageUrl" IS 'URL path to product image stored in Supabase storage bucket';
```

  <Typography level="body-sm">Product Image</Typography>
  
  {form.ImageUrl ? (
    // Image preview with delete button
  ) : (

  )}
  
  <Stack direction="row" spacing={1}>

console.log('Test by:');
console.log('1. Navigate to Purchase Orders page');
console.log('2. Click "Receive" on an approved purchase order');
console.log('3. Adjust quantities as needed');
console.log('4. Click "Receive" button in the dialog');
console.log('5. Verify the order status updates to "Received"');
console.log('6. Check that stock movements are created in the database');

// The old API test is no longer needed since we use direct Supabase calls
